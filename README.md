## Brief Overview of project
The learning aid will act as a behavioural therapy for children suffering with ADHD. Our application focuses on helping ADHD children through an interactive and fun app which would contain various games which will help the children of age (7-12) by testing and developing skills like concentration, creativity and patience.The parents/doctors will be able to monitor the child's performance progress of the child through AI. The ML model would generate graphs to analyze the childâ€™s progress. Finally, we determine the level of ADHD of the child using the scores and the feedback sheets of parents.
